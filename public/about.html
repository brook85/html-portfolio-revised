<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I have always been someone who values knowledge and perseverance, even from my
  early years. Growing up, I was fascinated by how things worked — I would take
  apart radios, open up flashlights, and wonder how electricity brought light
  and sound into our homes. That curiosity stayed with me through school, where
  I often gravitated toward math and science, even when they were challenging.
  My family and my faith gave me strength to keep pushing forward, even when
  resources were limited or the path wasn’t clear. After much dedication, I
  graduated in electrical engineering, which was a proud milestone in my life.
  But I didn’t stop there. I realized quickly that a degree was only the
  beginning, and real understanding comes from continued self-study and
  application. That’s why I’ve committed myself to lifelong learning — reading
  books, taking online courses, and exploring new technologies beyond what was
  taught at the university. This mindset has helped me grow not only as an
  engineer but also as a person who appreciates the beauty of learning and hard
  work. My history — filled with struggles, achievements, and self-discovery —
  shaped me into someone who strives to improve every day, no matter the
  obstacles.

  After graduating in electrical engineering, I came to see that education
  doesn’t end with a diploma. In fact, that’s when the real learning began for
  me. I started to study independently, diving deeper into topics that
  interested me and exploring areas that the classroom never fully covered. This
  journey of self-study has been deeply rewarding. It has allowed me to develop
  problem-solving skills, stay updated on new technologies, and expand my
  understanding beyond the basics. Looking back at my history — from a curious
  child to a dedicated student and now a self-driven learner — I am proud of how
  far I’ve come.

  My past has shaped me into who I am: a curious, determined, and self-motivated
  person. Graduating in electrical engineering was just the beginning; I
  continue to study and grow every day. From my childhood fascination with
  electricity to my self-studying habits today, I carry forward a passion for
  learning. My history reminds me that perseverance, faith, and curiosity can
  light the way toward a meaningful and fulfilling journey.
